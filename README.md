A basic, minimalist calculator app is a simple and easy-to-use calculator that is designed to perform basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. It is typically characterized by a clean and uncluttered user interface with a limited number of features.

**Here are some of the key features of a basic, minimalist calculator app:**
-   Simple and easy-to-use interface: The app should be easy to understand and use, even for people who are not familiar with calculators. The buttons should be large
    and clearly labeled, and the layout should be intuitive.
-   Limited number of features: The app should only have the features that are essential for performing basic mathematical operations. This will help to keep the app      simple and easy to use.
